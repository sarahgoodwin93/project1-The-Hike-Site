# [The Hike Site](https://sarahgoodwin93.github.io/The-Hike-Site/ "Link to The Hike Site Webpage")

![Responsive Image](assets/readme-img/responsive-screenshot.png "am i responsive screenshot image")

The Hike Site is by hikers for hikers. A place people can come to in order to get information for their hiking trip to Scotland. Could be a day hike or a multi-day wild camping trip, The Hike Site has helpful tips and tricks to make your adventure the best it can be.

The site will target people who are wanting to come to Scotland for a hiking trip and give information about different suggested walks, gear they could take, a checklist and a chance to sign up to a group walk.

The idea of the site comes from a need to combine walking suggestion sites, gear sites and house a checklist, all in the one place, to allow users to come to a one-stop-shop for their trip.

This is complimented by a lighter tints of {#eeb18f} and {#c4581d}
These colours were chosen as they represent the sunrises and sunsets often seen in Scotland during a hike, this can be seen in the hero image as well where the sunset compliments the colours.

![Wire Frames](assets/readme-img/wireframe.png "wireframe image")

### Typography

The font [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Barlow "Link to Barlow on Google Fonts webpage") has been used throughout the site, utilizing different weights and sizes to distigusted headings and text.

Sans-Serif has been applied as a back-up in case of import failure.

## Features

### Navigation

Each page has a navigation menu allowing the user to link back to the page they require information from.
The navigation options include:

- Home
- What to Pack
- Suggested Walks
- Sign Up

The navigation bar stays in the same place for each page, which allows people to navigate throughout the site without having to use a ‘back’ button, and allows them to access all areas of the site at any time.

### Hero Image

As the first thing users the hero image needs to capture their attention and make them want to stay on the site. It also shows that they have arrived at the correct place as it clearly shows both mountains and lochs which Scotland hikes are famous for.

![Hero Image](assets/readme-img/hero-readme.png "Screenshot of hero image")

### Home

- The landing includes a photograph that draws users attention to what the site is about and its purpose.
- The homepage gives links to different areas in Scotland for suggested walks to provide quick access to a specific region.
- This section introduces the user to a brief ‘about section’ so that they know if the site will suit their needs or not
- This page also provides links to the What to Pack page to give users additional access

The homepage contains the 'About section', as well as links to the other pages on 'The Hike Site'.

The Suggests Walks buttons allows users to click directly into the area they want to see, rather than having to navigate through the whole page via scrolling.

The two 'What to Pack' buttons allow users to go directly to their releveant walk length to be able to access the checklist straight away and see the suggested gear for that month.

The homepage will adjust to fit the size of your screen, with elements and sections moving from taking up the full width, to moving on-top of each other for smaller screen sizes.

### What to Pack Page

- Users can continue to return to the site to fill out the checklist for each trip they go on, adding value for returning users
- This page will also give links with gear suggestions should users wish to purchase new gear for their trip, there will be a top 5 every month to keep content fresh and exciting for returning users.
- 'Back to top' links have been added after each section so that users do not need to scroll all the way back up in they wish to move on from the page.

### Packing Checklists

Two checklists have been used for the two walk types, wild camping trips and day trips. Users can check that they have everything needed for their trip type in an easy to use checkbox style form, with the ability to reset at the end.

The form does not link to an external place as it is not for capturing data, it is a tool for users.

### Thank You Page

- After hitting the submit button on the sign up form users will be taken to the thank you page so that they know they have completed the form correctly.

### The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites, these are the main homepages for the relevant social media company as The Hike Site does not have their own (at this stage).

The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
